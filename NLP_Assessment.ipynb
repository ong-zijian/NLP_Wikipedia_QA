            "quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving pell's equation, and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups. these algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum fourier transform. no mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely.[self-published source?] certain oracle problems like simon's problem and the bernstein–vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.\n",
            "other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are bqp-complete. because these problems are bqp-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.\n",
            "some quantum algorithms, like grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms. though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems. many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are related to grover's algorithm, including brassard, høyer, and tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions, which uses grover's algorithm, and farhi, goldstone, and gutmann's algorithm for evaluating nand trees, which is a variant of the search problem.\n",
            "a notable application of quantum computation is for attacks on cryptographic systems that are currently in use. integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two -digit primes). by comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using shor's algorithm to find its factors. this ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. in particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by shor's algorithm. in particular, the rsa, diffie–hellman, and elliptic curve diffie–hellman algorithms could be broken. these are used to protect secure web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n",
            "identifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of post-quantum cryptography. some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which shor's algorithm applies, like the mceliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory. lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem. it has been proven that applying grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly / invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly  in the classical case, meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: aes- would have the same security against an attack using grover's algorithm that aes- has against classical brute-force search (see key size).\n",
            "the most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of  items in a database. this can be solved by grover's algorithm using  queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the  queries required for classical algorithms. in this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups.\n",

            "one of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. this usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. however, other sources of decoherence also exist. examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time  (for nmr and mri technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to  millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator) in order to prevent significant decoherence. a  study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.\n",
            "as a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.\n",
            "these issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n",
            "as described in the threshold theorem, if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. this allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. an often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is −, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n",
            "meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. however, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. the number required to factor integers using shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between l and , where l is the number of digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of l. for a -bit number, this implies a need for about  bits without error correction. with error correction, the figure would rise to about  bits. computation time is about  or about  steps and at , about  seconds. however, other careful estimates lower the qubit count to  for factorizing ,-bit integer in  months on a trapped-ion quantum computer.\n",
            "another approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.\n",

        "1. For simpler questions, the model generated the correct output and is factually correct. \n",
        "2. For more complicated and open-ended questions, the model does seem to struggle. From what I can infer, it is probably due to quality of the context. If the question is generated poorly from the context, it will roll over and affect the answer as well.\n",
        "3. Some of the question and answers are not of good quality which may be due to the sentence given as context. More could have been done, alternatively, if I was using this for some use case, I would just remove those with a poorer score and keep to better ones.\n",
        "4. The Rouge Score\n",
        "  - The precision is generally high and recall varies, but is significantly lower than the precision.\n",
        "  - This indicates that the model is very conservative and does not label true positives\n",
        "  - The pros and cons would depend, but if we are pruning by recall score, this will allow us to have a more accurate model, but at a cost of less information available.\n",
        "  - As a result, when looking at the fmeasure, there are scores that are on both ends of the spectrum. However, with a median of around `0.26` and mean of `0.31`, there leaves more to be desired.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There would be some things that I would like to improve on.\n",
        "1. Better regex and data clean. This is to ensure that no weirdly strung sentences end up in the data.\n",
        "2. Qualitative checks. The sentences are split with punctuation and the regex is was only capable of removing some of the standard clutters like special character and spaces. It would be nice to be able to handle some qualitative work, where there would be a filter to remove sentences that does not bring any value or are not relevant to our scenario.\n",
        "3. Better question generation models that would make the questions have a little context at least. For example, \"What the Germans do in the war\". Without the context of World War 2, and the sentence, The machine may give answers to Germanic wars from 17th to 19th century.\n",
        "4. Fine tune the model. I did not have the bandwidth to research and figure out how to do so. With more time and energy to spend on this project, I would be able to figure out the settings to do fine-tuning.\n",
